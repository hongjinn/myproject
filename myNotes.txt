# To start building your website, first make a new virtual environment for each separate machine
# that you will do development on. This is why venv/ is in .gitignore
# Also call it "venv" since mod_wsgi for apache2 will call out "venv" in the config files
# Just run these commands from the "myproject" root directory folder

pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv  # Upgrade your virtual environment
virtualenv -p python3 venv        # Create your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate           # Activate your virtual environment
pip3 install -r requirements.txt   # This installs all your dependencies
